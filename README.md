Meshy
=====

I'm trying to figure out how to set up a mesh network on Firefox OS phones. This is the application part of that. The name Meshy was merely convenient. I don't plan on publishing this app in any capacity (other than this GitHub repo).

I'm not a Firefox OS developer and am actually on the team working on necko (networking layer of gecko), so I wouldn't use this repo as an example of good code.

Running It
----------

You're not going to be able to without building your own development version of Firefox OS and doing some horrible things to enable Wifi direct.

Licensing
---------

I am writing this as an employee of Mozilla, so I don't have the ability to place this under an open license (not to say Mozilla would be against it, just that I don't actually own the copyright to it because it's work made for hire or whatever that term is). I'll try to resolve this at some point, but not the highest priority for me at the moment. Feel free to ping me if you actually want to use some of this code and I'll go bother the correct people.
